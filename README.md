# Arithmetic Exercise Generator
Super simple HTML page + JS that I use to generate arithmetic exercises for my son. 
It is now required for him to to solve 5 of those every time to unlock his right to watch cartoons :) . 

I will increase difficulty as he progresses.

*Just leaving it out there in case someone else finds it useful.*
Please do not expect high quality code :D. 

## How to use
Just download everything and open `index.html` in a browser. 

The whole thing is meant to be printed and used separately by the kids, and when you print the control panel will be hidden.

If you want to configure it, use the control panel at the top and then hit the *Generate* button, or if you want to go deeper there's a `config` variable in the `main.js` file.... well or change the whole JS.
