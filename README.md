# Arithmetic Exercise Generator
Super simple HTML page + JS that I use to generate arithmetic exercises for my son. 
It is now required for him to to solve 5 of those every time to unlock his right to watch cartoons :) . 
I will increase difficulty as he progresses.

*Just leaving it out there in case someone else finds it useful.*
Please do not expect high quality code :D. 

## How to use
Just download everything and open `index.html` in a browser. 

If you want to configure it, there's a `config` variable in the `main.js` file.
